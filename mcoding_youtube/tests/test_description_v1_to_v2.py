Most programming languages use a shared standard (IEEE 754 floating point numbers) for how to represent floating point numbers like 0.1. In this video, we see how these floats are represented and how this can cause unexpected results like 0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3.

This took my poor laptop over a week to render so please slap the subscribe button if you liked the video!

Every second, the x-axis doubles, every 2 seconds the y-axis doubles, giving zoom factors of 2^1800 and 2^900!

The colors are determined by the values on the right hand side, so on the left they are chaotic, and on the right they are ordered.
